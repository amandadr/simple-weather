A small, simple project for learning Vue.js

### Why weather? There's a billion APIs out there

Weather is deeply comforting for me, to a strange degree. It's chaotic, universal, and vernacular while also serving as a primary determinant of our lives. Weather gets _deep_, and gleefully welcomes change with every little gust of wind.

I'm the kind of weirdo that actually loves to talk about the weather. We all know and have some kind of opinion about it, which makes it universally approachable as a discussion point; it brings people together. While it may just be small talk, weather conversations make for a light-hearted interaction through which you can easily determine someone else's entire mood, demeanour, and personality. I can't recount the last acquaintance I've met that I haven't discussed weather with ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

I often stop to ponder what kind of weather my loved ones living away or my favourite places deep in the woods are experiencing, it helps me feel connected to the people and things I cherish deeply. Browsing conditions in towns my feet haven't travelled for a long time helps me imagine what it'd be like to be there again, running away from terrential rain, or shuffling a tattered pair of Converse through a drop of fluffy snow. I may miss a lot of places and their people, but when we all share one sky full of stars, it's impossible to feel too far away to imagine being with them.

Hopefully this app will help me start a few new conversations :)
